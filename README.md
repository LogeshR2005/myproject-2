# 🔐 Multi‑Platform Automated System Hardening Tool

A centralized automation tool to **secure Windows and Linux systems** by applying predefined hardening policies, tracking configuration changes, generating compliance reports, and supporting safe rollback.

---

## 📌 Overview

Managing OS‑level security manually across multiple systems is time‑consuming and error‑prone.  
This project simplifies the process by providing **one‑click, automated OS hardening** with verification, reporting, and rollback support.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Multi‑Platform Support**  
  Supports Windows (10, 11) and Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS)

- ⚙️ **Automated OS Hardening**  
  Applies predefined security parameters automatically

- 🔄 **Safe Rollback**  
  Restores previous configuration values when required

- 📊 **Compliance Reporting**  
  Generates detailed reports with:
  - Previous value / state  
  - Current value / state  
  - Success / failure status  

- 🔍 **Change Tracking**  
  Tracks every applied hardening parameter with timestamps

- 👨‍💻 **Easy to Use**  
  Designed for both novice and experienced administrators

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Detects the target operating system  
2. Captures existing configuration values  
3. Applies security hardening parameters  
4. Verifies the applied changes  
5. Logs previous & current states with status  
6. Allows rollback using stored values

## 📄 Reporting Output

Each hardening action records:
- Parameter name  
- Previous value / state  
- Current value / state  
- Status (Success / Failed)  
- Timestamp  

This enables **audit‑ready compliance reporting**.
